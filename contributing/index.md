Zetkin is a big collaboration. This guide is for **your very first hour** of
learning about it. Welcome!

This is a big document.

## Getting started

If you are a programmer, user interface designer, user experience designer, or have some other technical competence, you are welcome to contribute to the Zetkin project which would benefit all attached organizations.

Do you want to start contributing right now?

Frontend development in CSS, HTML and JavaScript (React)? You can start right away, on our Open Source projects, using GitHub Issues and Pull Requests to interact with the Zetkin maintainers.

Backend development in Python or Node.js? We do this, but you need to get in touch with the Zetkin maintainers to start doing that.

### Get a code collaboration account at GitHub

Zetkin projects use [GitHub Pull Requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) for collaboration. You will need [a personal GitHub account](https://github.com/join).

### Install Docker

To develop Zetkin, you need to **get a development environment started**. There
are instructions about this in different project READMEs. All of them use
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/), so begin by installing [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/get-started) for your computer platform.

#### Platform installation snags

Windows! To run Docker on Windows, you _may_ need to check which version of
Windows you are running.

If your Windows version is Windows Home, there is an installable piece of
software to support Docker. [Docker documentation: Install Docker Desktop on Windows Home](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install-windows-home/)

### Clone a project

Zetkin has three large projects you can access on [the Zetkin GitHub Organization](https://github.com/zetkin) right now:

- [www](https://github.com/zetkin/www.zetk.in#getting-started) - the activist-facing website
- [call](https://github.com/zetkin/call.zetk.in#getting-started) - a phone banking system
- [organize](https://github.com/zetkin/organize.zetk.in#getting-started) - the organizer tool

### Find a task!

Zetkin has many already-described tasks to go work on, in GitHub Issues, and we labeled some of
them as extra suitable for newcomers. [GitHub Issues labeled "Entry Level"](https://github.com/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+user%3Azetkin+label%3Aentry-level+).

Do not be discouraged if the text makes you feel like you have no idea what is
going on, these Issues are designed to be introduced by someone close to the
project.
