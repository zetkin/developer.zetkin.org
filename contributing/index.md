# Develop Zetkin, together

Zetkin is a big collaboration. This guide is for your very first hour of
learning about it. Welcome!

## Getting started

Do you want to start contributing right now?

Frontend development in CSS, HTML and JavaScript (React)? You can start right away, on our Open Source projects, using GitHub Issues and Pull Requests to interact with the Zetkin maintainers.

Backend development in Python or Node.js? We do this, but you need to get in touch with the Zetkin maintainers to start doing that.

Zetkin projects use [GitHub Pull Requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) for collaboration. You will need [a personal GitHub account](https://github.com/join).

To develop Zetkin, you need to **get a development environment started**. There
are instructions about this in different project READMEs. All of them use
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/), so begin by installing [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/get-started) for your computer platform.

### Open projects

Zetkin has three large projects you can access right now:

- [www](https://github.com/zetkin/www.zetk.in#getting-started)
- [call](https://github.com/zetkin/call.zetk.in#getting-started)
- [organize](https://github.com/zetkin/organize.zetk.in#getting-started)

### Find a task!

Zetkin has many already-described tasks to go work on, and we labeled some of
them as extra suitable for newcomers. [GitHub Issues labeled "Entry Level"](https://github.com/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+user%3Azetkin+label%3Aentry-level+).
